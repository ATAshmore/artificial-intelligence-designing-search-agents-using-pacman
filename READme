Pacman Search Agents
This repository contains the implementation of various search algorithms for guiding Pacman in finding food dots within mazes. The project focuses on four search algorithms:

Depth First Search
Breadth First Search
Uniform Cost Search
A* Search
Implementation
The search algorithms have been successfully implemented and applied to Pacman in different maze scenarios. Below is a brief summary of the algorithms:

Depth First Search: An uninformed search strategy that explores the deepest nodes first. Not guaranteed to be complete or optimal.

Breadth First Search: An uninformed search strategy that explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to the next level. Guaranteed to be complete but may not be optimal.

Uniform Cost Search: Expands nodes based on their path costs, choosing the node with the lowest cost first. Complete and optimal.

A Search:* An informed search strategy that evaluates nodes based on path cost and an estimated cost to the goal. Complete and optimal with admissible heuristics.

Results
Detailed results and discussions can be found in the project report.
